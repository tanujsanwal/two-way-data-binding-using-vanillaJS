Implement two way data binding using vanilla JavaScript


1. I am creating a tag with name dataBind and by giving the same class name of the other element in wich we have to do 2 way data binding. 


2. I am collecting all the classes of the elements on which i need to apply two way Data Binding in an array named classes.
